# FMv2+F2014
This repository is associated with the publication Battle et al, 2024.

It contains code to simulate the Arabidopsis Framework model v2 (FMv2), described in Chew et al, 2017 [https://doi.org/10.1101/105437], modified to include a new circadian clock module, described in Fogelmark K & Troein C (2014) [doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003705], and to simulate a new mutant, YHB, as described in Battle et al, 2024. It is based on the original code for the FMv2, which was downloaded from the github repository: https://github.com/danielseaton/frameworkmodel/ (FAIRDOM link: https://fairdomhub.org/models/248).

The scripts "Clock_Comparison_between_models.m" and "Hyp_Fl_comparison_for_two_clock_models.m" (MATLAB R2022a) run the model and produce plots and output files containing the simulation result.
